## Prerequisites

This sample is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), therefore it is needed as prerequisite to run this example.

## Setup

After cloning the repository, init the theme repository by running `git submodule update --init src/themes/introduction` **in the root directory**.

## Running the sample

1. Get into the `src` directory
2. Run `hugo server -D`
3. Access the URL given by the Terminal

## Running the image

Assuming you already have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed, just run `docker build -t image-name .` on the root directory.

To execute it, run: `docker run -p <local-port>:80 image-name`

You can also opt to run it from the remote source using `docker run -p <local-port>:80 mcr.microsoft.com/mslearn/samples/contoso-website`

## Deploying to Kubernetes

Inside the [Kubernetes](./kubernetes) directory, you'll have all necessary resources to deploy the application to an AKS cluster using the [HTTP Application Routing Addon](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/http-application-routing?WT.mc_id=learndeploycontainerappsaks-learn-ludossan).

1. Update the [Ingress.yaml](./kubernetes/ingress.yaml) file and update your specific DNS zone to the one you have in your AKS cluster, this information can be found in the DNS zone resource inside the resource group of your cluster
2. Use `Kubectl apply -f <filename>` to all the files in the directory to create the workloads

## Key concepts

Hugo is a static build engine that allows users to create static websites. The idea behind this demo is to show how we can deploy a containerized application to AKS.

There's a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) in the root of the repository, this Dockerfile is responsible for generating the image we'll be using to deploy the website. It's a simple NGINX default image, in it we do a few steps:

- Update all the packages
- Install curl, git and Node.js
- Download and install Hugo
- Install PostCSS and autoprefixer using NPM globally as they are requirements for the theme
- Clone the repository and init all submodules
- Generate a static web page from the website template
- Move that directory into NGINX public folder
- Expose port 80 so we can access it from the cluster
